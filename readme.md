# MGJSON format example

This a very simple demo file that can be imported in Adobe After Effects to read external dynamic and static data.

The underlying JSON schema is available for download under [Adobe's SensorManager SDK Package](https://console.adobe.io/downloads/ae).

Actual files filled with data will have to change a lot depending on the contained data, but since online documentation is extremely scarce, I thought this demo was worth posting.

For instructions on how to use the imported data, see [Work with Data-drive animation](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/data-driven-animations.html)

Feel free to publish your own samples if you think they can be useful for the community.
